mov ecx, some_valid_index
mov ebx, some_valid_base_address
mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4] ;This instruction should be safe now, as long as some_valid_index and some_valid_base_address are set properly
;Add error handling to check for invalid memory addresses
;For example, you could check if ebx + ecx*4 is within the valid memory range before accessing it.
